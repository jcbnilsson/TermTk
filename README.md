# TermTk

TermTk is a tiny C++20 library for creating terminal-based applications. It is built with
zero dependencies and is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your projects.
For this reason, it is also single-header, so you can just drop it into your project and
start using it.

The idea is to provide a thin wrapper around the terminal and OS-specific APIs (deduced at
compile-time) to save the programmer from having to deal with boilerplate, specifics and details,
while providing flexibility and power to the programmer and solid OS support.

The library is very much a work in progress and doesn't (yet) provide a ton of features,
but I am using it in my own projects and will continue to expand it as I need more features.
Contributions and/or feedback are very much welcome!

## Building

Oh... yeah, there is no building. Drop the header into your library and you're good to go.
